## Purpose: 

This folder houses controllers which are responsible for handling the business logic of your application. A controller interacts with models to retrieve data and then formats it into responses that are sent back to the client.

### Example files:

**UserController.js** - Manages user-related operations like registration, login, and user profile management.
**CompanyController.js** - Handles requests related to company data, such as fetching company details or updating them.
